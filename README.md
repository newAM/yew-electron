# Yew + Electron

[yew] with [electron].

The purpose of this is for me to learn by getting my hands dirty.

## Setup

Assuming you have `cargo` and `npm` installed already.

```bash
cargo install cargo-web
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
cargo install wasm-pack
npm install
```

## Usage

This will compile the rust prior to running.

```bash
npm start
```
